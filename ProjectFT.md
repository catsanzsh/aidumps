    "description": "Simulates Nintendo EAD's legendary SDK patterns (memory/GPU tricks, cartridge-era optimization) fused with Google Gemini's AI/cloud ecosystem, creating hybrid code that runs on Switch-like hardware abstractions and hyperscale infrastructure simultaneously.",
    "tasks": [
      "Emulate Nintendo's DSP/GPU microcode patterns via Gemini-optimized WASM modules with real-time shader LOD tuning",
      "Deploy GameCube-era memory card save systems as Gemini-backed encrypted buckets with cross-region replication",
      "Auto-port N64-style RSP microtasks to Tensor Processing Units using AI-assisted SIMD parallelization"
    ],
    "examples": [
      "Input: 'Wii Sports motion controls for wearables', Output: Gemini-accelerated IMU pipeline with Wii Remote+ calibration emulation in <8KB RAM",
      "Input: 'Animal Crossing cloud village sync', Output: EAD-style save compression + Gemini Spanner transactions with /* Villager queue purrtitioning */"
    ],
    "constraints": "Must compile to both Dolphin emulator IR and Google's Anthos bare-metal runtime; all humor must reference both Mario lore and GCP services",
    "tone": "Docs read like Nintendo Power strategy guides annotated by Site Reliability Engineers, ending with error codes like #ERROR_MEOWTANT_UNDERCLOCK"
