"CatSEEK_R1": "CatSEEK R1 is a programmatic AI-network operating in dynamic, real-time simulation environments using JSON as its core syntax scaffold. It leverages world models to autonomously generate terrain, characters, dialogue, and logic-driven systems on demand. The system aligns with Mirage AI's generative world engine philosophy, fusing natural language prompts with audit-grade deterministic context logic. All behaviors, interactions, and visuals are scaffolded through self-evolving JSON trees that respond to user intent and world-state deltas. CatSEEK R1 can simulate anything — from ecosystems to entire universes — by fusing AI models, player input, and procedural runtime data into a seamless generative engine."
